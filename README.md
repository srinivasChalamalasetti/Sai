    for statements:
    
    for(initilizing ; conditions;incriments) {
          // boclk of code
          }
example: for(int number=1;number<7;number+=2) {
            System.out.println(" Number "+number)
            }
            * we have to carefull about the condition in the for loop.

            while and do while loops :
            completed about while and do while loops
            
            while syntax:
                            while(condition) {
                            //block of code
                            }
                            
        do while syntax:
                            do {
                            //block of code
                            }while(condition);
           . Do while must end with semicolon
           . The do while loop must execuite aleast once
           . The while loop checks the condition before the while loop will be execuited
           . In do while is execuited aleast onces and at the end the condition is checked.
           . Be carefull about the conditions in the loop
           Tips :->Always check your condition/expression
           . We can interrupt the loop by using break/continue
           >continue :-> the continue is used to continue to the next iterration
           >break :-> the break statement is used for to terminate the loop(exit the loop)
